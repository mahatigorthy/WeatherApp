This project is an Android application that provides weather information based on a user's zip code. The main features include:

1. **User Input**: The user enters their zip code into an EditText field. The zip code is validated, and a button is enabled to fetch weather data.

2. **Fetching Coordinates**: When the user clicks the button, the app retrieves the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) corresponding to the provided zip code using the OpenWeatherMap API.

3. **Fetching Weather Data**: Using the coordinates, the app fetches hourly weather data, including temperature, weather description, and timestamp, for the next four hours.

4. **Displaying Data**: The app displays the retrieved weather data in a series of TextViews, showing the time, temperature, and a short description of the weather for each hour.

5. **Weather Icons**: The app dynamically updates a series of ImageViews with appropriate weather icons (e.g., clouds, rain, snow) based on the weather description for each hour.

Overall, the application integrates UI elements with API calls to provide a user-friendly way to access and display weather information based on a zip code.
